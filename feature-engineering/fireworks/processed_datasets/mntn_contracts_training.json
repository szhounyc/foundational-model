What is the home owner insurance requirement for this Unit? Is the sponsor eligible for mortgage recording tax credit? Buyer is obtaining financing. Does the sponsor require its lender to assign a portion of its mortgage to buyer’s lender to be consolidated with buyer’s new loan (customarily known as a “CEMA”) and Purchaser shall pay to sponsor an amount equal to (but not in excess thereof) the Mortgage Recording Tax that would otherwise be payable by Purchaser to the City and State of New York on the recording of Purchaser’s mortgage?  If it is required, the buyer needs to first talk with his/her lender to see if the bank accepts such an arrangement. Sponsor legal fees: sponsor will get financing. Does the buyer need to pay sponsor 1) ACRIC fees and 2) sponsor loan-related legal fees as the buyer is obtaining financing? PSA Comments"
